## 💡 About Me

I'm a data-driven problem solver with a strong interest in building impactful, real-world solutions. My work combines backend logic with data storytelling — blending structure with meaning.  
Though I come from a place of faith, I thrive in logic — which reflects in my projects like **BibleQuest**, a Django web app that merges spiritual engagement with clean backend architecture and data operations.

## 😄 Fun Fact

Even though I analyze data and write code every day, I start each morning with a Bible verse — because I believe the heart and logic can go hand-in-hand when solving meaningful problems.
